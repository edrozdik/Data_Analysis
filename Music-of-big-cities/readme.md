**Music Trends in Major Cities**
===

**Task**

Check three hypotheses:
User activity depends on the day of the week. This is different in Moscow and St. Petersburg. On Monday morning, some genres are more popular in Moscow, while others are more popular in St. Petersburg. The same goes for Friday evening - different genres are popular depending on the city.  
Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres.  
In Moscow, people listen to pop music more often, while in St. Petersburg, Russian rap is more popular.  

Research process
You'll get user behavior data from the file yandex_music_project.csv. The quality of the data is unknown. So, before testing the hypotheses, you'll need to review the data.  
You'll check the data for errors and evaluate how these errors might affect the study. Then, during the preprocessing stage, you'll try to fix the most critical data errors.  
So, the study will have three stages:  
1. Data overview
2. Data preprocessing
3. Testing hypotheses
